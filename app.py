In the decade since, the project has expanded to Africa, Oceania, and Latin America, significantly broadening China‚Äôs economic and political influence.")

Meanwhile, the United States shares the concern of some in Asia that the BRI could be a Trojan horse for China-led regional development and military expansion. President Joe Biden has maintained his predecessors‚Äô skeptical stance towards Beijing‚Äôs actions, but Washington has struggled to offer participating governments a more appealing economic vision.")
